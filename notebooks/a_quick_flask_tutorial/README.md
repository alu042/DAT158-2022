# A very short crash course in web app development using Flask

This is the code shown in the DAT158 video describing a way to deploy machine learning models, using Flask. You can find the video in the course Canvas. The examples will likely not make a great deal of sense without the video, so you should start there.

Deployment is an important part of the course's Module 3, and of Assignment 2.

Here we demonstrate this using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com), a simple yet powerful Python-based web framework. This is not a comprehensive Flask tutorial, but a quick demo of some basics. The goal is to give you something you can potentially use and further extend in your own work.

The tutorial consists of five examples, building on each other.

- Example 1: A _very_ simple web application using Flask
- Example 2: Styling the application using Bootstrap
- Example 3: Adding web forms using WTForms
- Example 4: HospitalApp: Deploying machine learning models with Flask
- Example 5: Deploying Flask web apps using Heroku
